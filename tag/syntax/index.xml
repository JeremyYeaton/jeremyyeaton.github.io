      <title>Language production in aphasia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Language impairments, broadly known as &lt;em&gt;aphasia&lt;/em&gt; are a common result of left hemisphere stroke. Aphasia looks different for every patient, but there are patterns across individuals between what area is damaged and what parts of the language system are impaired. By comparing the language abilities and brain scans of a large cohort of adults with aphasia, we can extract patterns to help us better understand the composition of the language system, as well as which parts of the brain underlie the components of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Parallel processing in reading</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is the umbrella for a large research program encompassing behavioral, eye-tracking, modelling, and neuroimaging experiments as part of an ERC Advanced Grant looking at parallel orthographic and sentence processing during reading. The PI on this project is Jonathan Grainger.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ambiguity in negative dependencies</title>
      <link>https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/project/negation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/project/negation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many languages exhibit Negative Concord, that is when two negative items are interpreted as a single negation. For example, if a man has robbed a bank and says &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do nothing&lt;/em&gt;, we understand this as &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything&lt;/em&gt; even though he used two negative words&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. By contrast, if a mother comes home from work and finds her child sitting in front of the television, she might accuse them of having done nothing all day, to which they might reply &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do nothing&lt;/em&gt;. The child, however means exactly the opposite of what the bank robber meant &amp;ndash; that they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. French speakers have been shown to easily access both of these readings (Déprez et al. 2015), so we&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken a series of experiments to see how context (Déprez &amp;amp; Yeaton 2018), and prosody (Yeaton &amp;amp; Déprez forthcoming) might be employed to convey meaning. We also want to examine how good listeners are at leveraging these prosodic signals to access the meaning that the speaker intended (Loder et al. forthcoming).&lt;/p&gt;
