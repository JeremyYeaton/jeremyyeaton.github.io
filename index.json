In two experiments conducted with a non-human primate species (Guinea baboons, Papio papio), we addressed simple questions on the learning of simple AB associations appearing in longer noisy sequences. Using a serial reaction time task, we manipulated the position of AB within the sequence, such that it could be either fixed (by appearing always at the beginning, middle, or end of a four-element sequence; Experiment 1) or variable (Experiment 2). We also tested the effect of sequence length in Experiment 2 by comparing the performance on AB when it was presented at a variable position within a sequence of four or five elements. The slope of RTs from A to B was taken for each condition as a measurement of learning rate. While all conditions differed significantly from a no-regularity baseline, we found strong evidence that the learning rate did not differ between the conditions. These results indicate that regularity extraction is not impacted by the position of the regularity within a sequence and by the length of the sequence. These data provide novel general empirical constraints for modeling associative mechanisms in sequence learning.","tags":["statistical learning","non-human primates","language"],"title":"Simple questions on simple associations: regularity extraction in non-human primates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremy Yeaton","Maria Muelas-Gil","Gregory Scontras"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677877513,"objectID":"ab46cf9c22c947c55b188a9a573b62fd","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/publication/yeaton23gender/","publishdate":"2023-03-03T21:19:50.230532Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yeaton23gender/","section":"publication","summary":"Amidst social changes in gendered language use, there is pushback from institutions such as the Spanish Royal Academy, which claims that the use of the generic masculine (e.g., bomberos ‘firemen’) in describing a mixed-gender group is equally inclusive of both men and women (Bosque 2012). By contrast, speakers of Spanish have increasingly adopted gender-inclusive alternatives to the generic masculine (e.g., bomberos o bomberas; Bengoechea 2015). Across two behavioral tasks, we investigated whether gender-inclusive forms actually lead to more  inclusive interpretations. We found that the use of the inclusive form (by contrast to the generic masculine) indeed yields more inclusive interpretations, increasing the inferred femaleness of stereotypically male professions, but also decreasing the inferred femaleness of stereotypically female professions. In an attempt to explain the reasoning that delivers inclusive interpretations, we developed a computational cognitive model of the reasoning process. Our model treats the phenomenon as an instance of a markedness implicature: speakers use the longer, inclusive form to guide listeners away from their prior expectations. This work highlights the need for further research into the use of gender-inclusive language cross-linguistically, as well as for pushback against prescriptive institutions perpetuating stereotypes.","tags":["RSA","gender","co-registration","Spanish","language"],"title":"Gender-inclusive language as a Rational Speech Act in Spanish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua Snell","Jeremy Yeaton","Jonathan Mirault","Jonathan Grainger"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677877513,"objectID":"0b3dda93b2cf37651e6f21b77a963254","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/publication/snell-pof-syn/","publishdate":"2023-03-03T21:19:50.230532Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snell-pof-syn/","section":"publication","summary":"During reading, the brain is confronted with many relevant objects at once. But does lexical processing occur for multiple words simultaneously? Cognitive science has yet to answer this prominent question. Recently it has been argued that the issue warrants supplementing the field's traditional toolbox (response times, eye-tracking) with neuroscientific techniques (EEG, fMRI). Indeed, according to the OB1-reader model, upcoming words need not impact oculomotor behavior per se, but parallel processing of these words must nonetheless be reflected in neural activity. Here we combined eye-tracking with EEG, time-locking the neural window of interest to the fixation on target words in sentence reading. During these fixations, we manipulated the identity of the subsequent word so that it posed either a syntactically legal or illegal continuation of the sentence. In line with previous research, oculomotor measures were unaffected. Yet, syntax impacted brain potentials as early as 100 ms after the target fixation onset. Given the EEG literature on syntax processing, the presently observed timings suggest parallel word reading. We reckon that parallel word processing typifies reading, and that OB1-reader offers a good platform for theorizing about the reading brain.","tags":["eye tracking","fixation related potentials","parafoveal on foveal effects","parallel processing","reading","EEG","co-registration","French","language"],"title":"Parallel word reading revealed by fixation-related brain potentials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Viviane Déprez","Jeremy Yeaton"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1642118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621535872,"objectID":"bac9fb474fe6a9f28091031b5b2364f7","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/publication/deprez-yeaton-2022-nc/","publishdate":"2021-05-14T18:37:52.499642Z","relpermalink":"/publication/deprez-yeaton-2022-nc/","section":"publication","summary":"While it has long been assumed that prosody can help resolve syntactic and semantic ambiguities, empirical evidence has shown that the mapping between prosody and meaning is complex (Hirschberg \u0026 Avesani 2000; Jackendoff 1972). This paper investigates the prosody of ambiguous French sentences with multiple potentially negative terms that allow two semantically very distinct interpretations—a single negation reading involving negative concord (NC), and a double negative reading (DN) with a positive meaning reflecting a strictly compositional interpretation— with the goal to further research on the role of prosody in ambiguities by examining whether intonation can be recruited by speakers to signal distinct interpretations of these sentences to hearers. Twenty native speakers produced transitive sentences with potentially negative terms embedded in contexts designed to elicit single-negation or double-negation readings. Analysis regarding the F0 and the duration of the utterances revealed distinct prosodic profiles for the two readings, confirming previous evidence that speakers can produce characteristic acoustic cues to signal intended distinctive meanings (Kraljic \u0026 Brennan 2005; Syrett, Simon \u0026 Nisula 2014). Our results reveal that the NC readings feature a focused subject and a post-focally more compressed object, in contrast to the DN readings where both the subject and the object were independently focused. They do not relate DN to contradiction but link negative meaning with focus on French negative concord items (NCI). The paper discusses broad implications of these findings for theoretical approaches to NC and outlines further questions for the syntax-prosody interface of these constructions.","tags":[],"title":"The prosody of French ambiguous multiple negative sentences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremy Yeaton","Laure Tosatto","Joel Fagot","Jonathan Grainger","Arnaud Rey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635984000,"objectID":"a3f633f55eb18504a320402663f67dd0","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/talk/psychonomics2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/psychonomics2021/","section":"talk","summary":"While associative learning has been studied for decades, the focus has tended to be on longer sequences.

In Experiment 1 the ordinal cue was presented prior to onset of the letter string, and the underscore cue presented at string offset. In Experiments 2 and 3, both the ordinal and the underscore cues were pre-cues. In all Experiments, letter strings could either appear centered on fixation or shifted randomly to the left or to the right. Participants were tested in separate blocks of trials for each of the four conditions generated by the combination of cue-type and string-location variability. In Experiment 1, letter identification accuracy was higher with ordinal cues and with fixed string locations, and ordinal cueing was more affected by string location variability. In Experiments 2 and 3, letter identification accuracy was higher with underscore pre-cues. We conclude that under conditions of brief stimulus durations (100 ms) and backward masking, letter-in-string identification accuracy is determined by read-out from location-specific letter detectors, independently of the type of cueing. Differences in the effectiveness of different types of cue are determined by differences in the ease of isolating a given gaze-centered location, and by differences in the ease with which attention can be directed to that location.","tags":["letter perception","orthographic processing","parallel processing","reading","language"],"title":"Positional cueing, string location variability, and letter-in-string identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephane Dufau","Jeremy Yeaton","Sofie Chen","Jean-Michel Badier","Jonathan Grainger"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1610496000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607971072,"objectID":"9ee1ac053f98f6403525cfa4d52bb78d","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/publication/dufau-2021-meg/","publishdate":"2021-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dufau-2021-meg/","section":"publication","summary":"A word is better recognized when presented in a grammatical sequence of words (e.g., within a sentence) than when presented in an ungrammatical sequence of words.

A previous EEG investigation of this phenomenon pointed toward an online, automatic processing of linguistic information starting at around 270 ms post-stimulus onset. Taken together, these results support the idea of an early role of the syntactic network in facilitating the recognition of a word presented in a sentence context, leading to the question of how this network is set in motion. To answer this question, we conducted an MEG experiment and source analysis of the brain areas implicated in syntactic processing. Source activations over time showed grammatical vs. ungrammatical differences first in the inferior frontal gyrus (325-400 ms), then the anterior middle temporal gyrus (475-525 ms), and finally in both in the inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior middle temporal gyrus (550-600 ms).

Here we focus on perhaps the simplest and the strongest Parafoveal-on-Foveal (PoF) manipulation: word n + 1 is either the same as word n or a different word. Participants read sentences for comprehension and when their eyes left word n, the repeated or unrelated word at position n + 1 was swapped for a word that provided a syntactically correct continuation of the sentence. We recorded electroencephalogram and eye-movements, and time-locked the analysis of fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to fixation of word n. We found robust PoF repetition effects on gaze durations on word n, and also on the initial landing position on word n. Most important is that we also observed significant effects in FRPs, reaching significance at 260 ms post-fixation of word n. Repetition of the target word n at position n + 1 caused a widely distributed reduced negativity in the FRPs. Given the timing of this effect, we argue that it is driven by orthographic processing of word n + 1, while readers were still looking at word n, plus the spatial integration of orthographic information extracted from these two words in parallel.","tags":["eye tracking","fixation related potentials","parafoveal on foveal effects","parallel processing","reading","EEG","co-registration","French","language"],"title":"Parafoveal-on-foveal repetition effects in sentence reading: A co-registered eye-tracking and electroencephalogram study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremy Yeaton"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607029514,"objectID":"d4edd4090e4d58a2f14bd0c80af0b62a","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/publication/yeaton-thesis-2019/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T21:19:51.130393Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yeaton-thesis-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper lays out a pilot study conducted to examine the roles of Cross-Linguistic Influence (CLI) and cognitive resources on processing and parsing in a second language.
