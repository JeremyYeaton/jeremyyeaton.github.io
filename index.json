In this work, we conducted a series of experiments using a serial response time (RT) task with a group of Guinea baboons. We focused specifically on simple two-element AB regularities in a noisy sequence. We asked whether positioning within the sequence might impact learning rate. AB regularities were embedded in fixed positions (Exp. 1; beginning, middle, or end) or variable position (Exp. 2) within a four-element sequence. RT from A to B was measured during each 500-trial block. The slope of the line fit to these RTs was taken for each condition. While the slope of all of our experimental conditions differed significantly from our random (no regularity) baseline condition, we found strong evidence that the learning rate did not differ between the AB conditions. These results indicate that learning is not impacted by position in sequence, even when that position is variable.","tags":["statistical learning","associative learning","animal cognition","sequence learning","baboons","comparative cognition"],"title":"Simple questions on simple associations: Regularity extraction in Papio papio","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeremy Yeaton","Grant Walker","Julius Fridriksson","Gregory Hickok"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633564800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633564800,"objectID":"72a6c6f7b2bc5960a9589a3993a225b0","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/talk/snl2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/snl2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation about MEG results at Psychonomics 2020.","tags":["aphasia","naming","language"],"title":"Error detection and correction among adults with aphasia in a naming task","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeremy Yeaton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622937600,"objectID":"0b0111accd2429df9e47f9baf77757ed","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/talk/lsci202c/","publishdate":"2021-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/lsci202c/","section":"talk","summary":"Final presentation for LSCI 202C","tags":["statistical learning","associative learning","animal cognition","sequence learning","baboons","comparative cognition"],"title":"Are you smarter than a Guinea Baboon?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeremy Yeaton","Gregory Hickok"],"categories":[],"content":"Language impairments, broadly known as aphasia are a common result of left hemisphere stroke.

The position of the to-be-identified letter was either indicated by an ordinal cue (e.g., position 2) or an underscore cue (e.g., \\#####). In Experiment 1 the ordinal cue was presented prior to onset of the letter string, and the underscore cue presented at string offset. In Experiments 2 and 3, both the ordinal and the underscore cues were pre-cues. In all Experiments, letter strings could either appear centered on fixation or shifted randomly to the left or to the right. Participants were tested in separate blocks of trials for each of the four conditions generated by the combination of cue-type and string-location variability. In Experiment 1, letter identification accuracy was higher with ordinal cues and with fixed string locations, and ordinal cueing was more affected by string location variability. In Experiments 2 and 3, letter identification accuracy was higher with underscore pre-cues. We conclude that under conditions of brief stimulus durations (100 ms) and backward masking, letter-in-string identification accuracy is determined by read-out from location-specific letter detectors, independently of the type of cueing. Differences in the effectiveness of different types of cue are determined by differences in the ease of isolating a given gaze-centered location, and by differences in the ease with which attention can be directed to that location.","tags":["letter perception","orthographic processing","parallel processing","reading","language"],"title":"Positional cueing, string location variability, and letter-in-string identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Viviane Déprez","Jeremy Yeaton"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1621382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621535872,"objectID":"fb35abce045accd062250e7d8e09c058","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/publication/deprez-yeaton-2021-nc/","publishdate":"2021-05-14T18:37:52.499642Z","relpermalink":"/publication/deprez-yeaton-2021-nc/","section":"publication","summary":"While it has long been assumed that prosody can help resolve syntactic and semantic ambiguities, empirical evidence has shown that the mapping between prosody and meaning is complex (Hirschberg \u0026 Avesani, 2000; Jackendoff, 1972). This paper investigates the  prosody of ambiguous French sentences with multiple potentially negative terms that allow two semantically very distinct interpretations—a single negation reading involving so-called negative concord (NC), and a double negative reading (DN) with a positive meaning reflecting a strictly compositional interpretation—with the goal to further research on the role of prosody in ambiguities by examining whether intonation can be recruited by speakers to signal distinct interpretations of these sentences to hearers. Twenty native speakers produced transitive sentences with potentially negative terms embedded in contexts designed to elicit single-negation or double-negation readings. Analysis regarding the F0 and the duration of the utterances revealed distinct prosodic profiles for the two readings, confirming previous evidence that speakers can produce characteristic acoustic cues to signal intended distinctive meanings (Kraljic \u0026 Brennan, 2005; Syrett, Simon, \u0026 Nisula, 2014).  Our results reveal that NC readings feature a focused subject and a deaccented object, in contrast to DN readings where both the subject and the object were independently focused. They do not relate DN to contradiction but link negative meaning with focus on French negative concord items (NCI). The paper discusses the implications of these findings for theoretical approaches to NC and outlines further questions for the syntax-prosody interface of these constructions.","tags":[],"title":"The prosody of French ambiguous multiple negative sentences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephane Dufau","Jeremy Yeaton","Sofie Chen","Jean-Michel Badier","Jonathan Grainger"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1610496000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607971072,"objectID":"9ee1ac053f98f6403525cfa4d52bb78d","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/publication/dufau-2021-meg/","publishdate":"2021-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dufau-2021-meg/","section":"publication","summary":"A word is better recognized when presented in a grammatical sequence of words (e.g., within a sentence) than when presented in an ungrammatical sequence of words. This sentence superiority effect was recently demonstrated in a series of behavioral experiments where participants had better word identification rates for all positions in a sentence relative to an ungrammatical sequence of the same words. A previous EEG investigation of this phenomenon pointed toward an online, automatic processing of linguistic information starting at around 270 ms post-stimulus onset. Taken together, these results support the idea of an early role of the syntactic network in facilitating the recognition of a word presented in a sentence context, leading to the question of how this network is set in motion. To answer this question, we conducted an MEG experiment and source analysis of the brain areas implicated in syntactic processing. Source activations over time showed grammatical vs. ungrammatical differences first in the inferior frontal gyrus (325-400 ms), then the anterior middle temporal gyrus (475-525 ms), and finally in both in the inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior middle temporal gyrus (550-600 ms). We interpret the spatio-temporal dynamic of the sentence superiority effect in terms of an Interactive-Activation model with bottom-up activations and top-down influences operating between word and sentence-level representations.","tags":["MEG","French","language","reading","parallel processing"],"title":"The sentence superiority effect in the reading brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giovanni M.

We measured the temporal response functions (TRFs) for acoustic, phonemic, phonotactic, and semantic features in individual participants and found a main effect of proficiency on linguistic encoding. This effect of second-language proficiency was particularly prominent on the neural encoding of phonemes, showing stronger encoding of “new” phonemic contrasts (i.e., English contrasts that do not exist in Mandarin) with increasing proficiency. Overall, we found that the nonnative listeners with higher proficiency levels had a linguistic feature representation more similar to that of native listeners, which enabled the accurate decoding of language proficiency. This result advances our understanding of the cortical processing of linguistic information in second-language learners and provides an objective measure of language proficiency.","tags":["EEG","L2","bilingualism","naturalistic stimuli","speech","decoding","English","Chinese","language"],"title":"Neural representation of linguistic feature hierarchy reflects second-language proficiency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremy Yeaton","Stephane Dufau","Jonathan Grainger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605744000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605744000,"objectID":"8295d773e38810aebc005213a5bb0347","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/talk/psychonomics2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/psychonomics2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation about MEG results at Psychonomics 2020.","tags":["MEG","parallel processing","syntax","language"],"title":"Activation of syntax-sensitive structures in the reading brain","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeremy Yeaton","Arnaud Rey","Laure Tosatto"],"categories":[],"content":"In a series of experiments using a motor sequence learning task, we are examining the effect of different types of noise on the baboons' ability to extract a regularity (e.g.: AB) from a sequence.

Participants read sentences for comprehension and when their eyes left word n, the repeated or unrelated word at position n + 1 was swapped for a word that provided a syntactically correct continuation of the sentence. We recorded electroencephalogram and eye-movements, and time-locked the analysis of fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to fixation of word n. We found robust PoF repetition effects on gaze durations on word n, and also on the initial landing position on word n. Most important is that we also observed significant effects in FRPs, reaching significance at 260 ms post-fixation of word n. Repetition of the target word n at position n + 1 caused a widely distributed reduced negativity in the FRPs. Given the timing of this effect, we argue that it is driven by orthographic processing of word n + 1, while readers were still looking at word n, plus the spatial integration of orthographic information extracted from these two words in parallel.","tags":["eye tracking","fixation related potentials","parafoveal on foveal effects","parallel processing","reading","EEG","co-registration","French","language"],"title":"Parafoveal-on-foveal repetition effects in sentence reading: A co-registered eye-tracking and electroencephalogram study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Grainger","Jeremy Yeaton","Stephane Dufau","Jonathan Mirault"],"categories":[],"content":"This project is the umbrella for a large research program encompassing behavioral, eye-tracking, modelling, and neuroimaging experiments as part of an ERC Advanced Grant looking at parallel orthographic and sentence processing during reading.

The main goal of the previous study was to investigate whether the presence or absence of a syntactic feature (in this case V2 word order) would predict electrophysiological and/or behavioral responses to syntactic (word order) violations in the second language. The study found that while +/-V2 in the L1 did not seem to influence behavioral data, it did show some influence on the EEG results. The goal of the present study is twofold. We seek first to replicate the previous online and offline results found in a-V2 population, and then investigate the role of linguistic and cognitive variables in modulating the anticipated effect. We show that the same effect demonstrated by the-V2 participants in Andersson et al. (2018) is borne out in our French participants in the form of an anterior P600 effect. Furthermore, our data show a relationship between offline measures of cognitive functioning and online responses to linguistic stimuli.

In NC, two or more syntactic negations yield a single semantic one (e.g., the ‘I ate nothing’ reading of “I didn’t eat nothing”), and in DN each negation contributes to the semantics (e.g. ‘It is not the case that I ate nothing’). That NC and DN have been shown to coexist calls into question the hypothesis that grammars are either NC or DN (Zeijlstra 2004), and supports micro-parametric views of these phenomena (Déprez 2011; Blanchette 2017).
